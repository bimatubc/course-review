## Note on CLASP deployment
Please make sure the app have access to your google account
The easiest way (at least what I found to be easiest) to do this is by creating a trigger in the apps script, authorise access, and then delete the trigger
Don't ask me why, it's just some quirks of apps script I guess

## For database & script edit access
